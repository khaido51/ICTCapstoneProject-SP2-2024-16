Web Application Core Feature:<br>
  *Uploading single and multiple CSV files <br>
  *Validate CSV file structure <br>
  *Visualize line graph <br>
  *Visualize multiple line graph <br>
  *Visualize 3D graph <br>
  *Download graph as PNG file <br>
 <br>

The following screenshots will demonstrate the working flow of the web application.
